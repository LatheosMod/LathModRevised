Temporarily disabled steel armor due to an intermittent null reference exception that seems to occur randomly when armor is generated by loot. So far the error is elusive, as it does not occur with any reliable regularity.

----->31 Dec 2015<-----
LathMod 2.92
Re-enabled steel armor, but commented out the DescriptionKey property - that may be the culprit. Keeping steel armor as craft-only for the time being to reduce chances of spawned loot generating null reference exception in case it's not that
Renamed fireglass to Fire Glass, candleglass to Candle Glass, torchglass to Torch Glass
Added long drawbridge. Where [X] is the bridge block, and 0 is open space, it deploys this way: 000[X]0000, and extends to XXX[X]XXXX. This will require a support column for the bridge block to sit on, but does extend to a long bridge. The actual size of the bridge can be adjusted to fit. It currently is set to 1,1,8; changing the last value adjusts the length. It is currently stable at its current length.
Added stone bridge - a shorter drawbridge that matches concrete instead of reinforced wood. It deploys 000[X]000, and extends XXX[X]XXX. This is essentially the horizontal door from Alpha 12.5.
